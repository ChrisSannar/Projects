## Svelte Channel Post

Has anyone been able to test svelte components that use typescript? I've been using jest and I keep getting parsing errors or simply the tests don't seem to complete. Before you ask...
* The typescript components compile and the application runs properly
* Tests on svelte components that use vanilla run fine
* Only when I add
* I have made sure to include 'svelte-ts-preprocessing' in both my rollup.config and jest.config
My guess is that I have some sort of configuration missing. I'm just going for a 'HelloWorld' level of testing (trying to do TDD here)
